## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## To Do
- create a function to calculate the intercept point for a moving missile ( in a linear function with same speed )
- create a radar service to identify threats and defend missiles.
- create a launcher from which all rockets will shoot
- add some house pictures ( webp )
- add an abstract class for moving and not moving objects ( aka elements ), so target won't be missile, but MovingObject | NotMovingObject
- add gravity ( missile will move in parabolic trajectory )
- add health for every Moving and NotMoving object
- add damage for Moving objects
